interpretation of the model output

Urban Cover and Precipitation → Urban environments provide important 
foraging and nesting resources for Hadedas — consistent with their 
known association with irrigated lawns and urban trees.

Precipitation Effect → Higher precipitation increases soil
moisture and prey availability, increasing occupancy.

Temperature Effect → High temperatures reduce occupancy — 
possibly due to heat stress or reduced prey activity.

Interaction Effect → The negative interaction suggests that 
precipitation partially offsets the negative effects of high 
temperature — likely through increased soil moisture or food availability in wetter conditions.
